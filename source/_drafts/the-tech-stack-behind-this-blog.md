title: "The tech stack behind this blog"
tags: tech, programming
---

When I decided to start this project: a space to write about technology and software engineering, I wanted a minimalist tool to work with.

Developers are a different race. We don't usually mind about style, font type, text columns, photos, videos or any other fancy thing a usual wordpress blog would have. Developers usually only care about text, and code (which is text but in a special format).

In the last years I noticed how the best developers I was following, had minimalist blogs and were using such basic tools for write that didn't deviate them from the main goal: to write a post.

* [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com/) uses [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* [substack](http://substack.net/) uses [markdown](https://github.com/substack/blog) to store his posts, and some black magic for putting them together into fancy html.
* [Kyle Simpson](http://getify.me/) a.k.a @getify uses 90s plain unstyled html,

And so on.

A static generator was the tool I was looking for.

So, that being said, there is no much to explain. The tech stack behind this blog is simple, but effective. It does the work and does it well.

I'm using:

* [hexo.io](https://hexo.io/) , a static content generator, for blog engine.
* [carbon]() theme, now forked and customized by myself
