# First, some stories

## How an jpeg image used to load in the early days of internet.
Remember how a jpeg image used to load in the 90s ? when internet was popular in homes and we started to browse web pages and create email accounts ?

## A Street Fighter vs a Navy Seal
Imagine this fight. A healthy bold guy raised in the streets, facing hostile situation every day, swaying on his feet back and forward, with his fists on guard, anxious, waiting for his oponent.
Meanwhile, this quiet soldier, determinated in a firm position over his legs, also with his fists on guard, waiting for the first attack.
The street fighter might have spirit, and even skills. The trained soldier might not need to use his spirit to win this fight. To him, the duration of this fight represents so little compared to the time he has invested in training.
The difference between them, is that the street fighter has learned by demand, every time he fights for real, he has the opportunity to gain experience, while the navy seal has learned by practicing over and over.

The same way we could compare a developer who has trained himself against another one who learns only when the necessity exists.

Let's say you're building a web app in your prefered language/framework, that needs to send an email to send some reports. You've never worked before with an email library for such language. You invest some hours looking for a good third party library, read example code, and start to implement it right away into the real app. You have some errors on the way, but move forward on solving them, even you have no a strong idea of what you're doing, you succeed, having a functional solution just enough to overcome the obstacle.
If you look for inmediate results, you've done a great job. Really.
But thinking in long term, you're sitting on a time bomb. That piece of code taked out of nowhere will blow up in your face some day. And the sad part is that, if you don't invest time to refactor and re-design that code, you won't have enough knowledge to fix it by the time it throws an error.

What I'm saying, is that, ocassionally, we'll have to face problems where uncertainity exists. Sometimes you'll be the guy that doesn't know anything about the problem you have in front. But, most of the times, you'll have and you should make time to prepare yourself for future problems. This is where the best guys excel. They spent a significative amount of time on improving their craft, either learning new techniques, or practicing the most common ones.
And if you don't know what are the most common problems in your profession, you should start to looking for them, because they exist.
I'll give you a hint of what most of the real world applications has in common:

- User authentication
- Input data validation
- Data storage
- Domain logic
- Application testing

You know who are the guys that have rethinked about these scenarios and improved the solutions ? the guys that built the framework you are using.
The guys that build ruby on rails, python django, php laravel, they went one step beyond most of the developers and created elegant solutions over common problems.
